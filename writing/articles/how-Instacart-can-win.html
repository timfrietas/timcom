    <h1 class="content_name">The Biggest Threat to Amazon may be Instacart — and Here is How They Can Win</h1>
    <div class="section-copy">

      <p>I “joined” Amazon in 2006. I qualify this statement because I was actually hired by a wholly-owned subsidiary which became the self-publishing arm of Amazon (CreateSpace).</p>

      <p>In doing so I inadvertently earned a prime (no pun intended) seat in the operating theater, where I had an unparalleled view to Amazon’s surgical approach for market expansion and domination. I would go on to spend nearly 10 years at Amazon but the playbook never really changed.</p>

      <blockquote>Amazon enters a market then expands vertically as fast as they can.</blockquote>
      
      <p>
        For example this is what selling physical books looked like at Amazon before on-demand self-publishing:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Author writes book</li>
        <li>Author (after years) gets book deal with publisher if they are lucky</li>
        <li>Publisher announces release list with upcoming books</li>
        <li>Buyers at Amazon would attempt to project demand</li>
        <li>An order would be placed for inventory</li>
        <li>Inventory (say, 1000 copies) arrived and were stowed in an Amazon Fulfillment center</li>
        <li>The books took up space on shelves</li>
        <li>Someone clicked the Buy button</li>
        <li>One book was was pulled from a shelf</li>
        <li>It was shipped to a customer</li>
        <li>999 books remained on the shelf</li>
      </ol>

     <p> By the time I left the on-demand publishing team at Amazon, this is what the same process looked like:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Author writes book</li>
        <li>Author uploads book to Amazon (maintaining their IP rights)</li>
        <li>Someone buys book</li>
        <li>The book would either be delivered instantly (Kindles were now ubiquitous) or produced on-demand in under two hours, cover and all.</li>
        <li>It was shipped to a customer, never hitting a shelf.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>This offered Amazon several benefits:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>They no longer had to forecast demand for many titles (especially “long tail” and niche titles).</li>
        <li>They created a direct relationship with the content creators of the future before they got tied up with publishers who were slowing down content submission.</li>
        <li>They increased royalties for self-publishers (and the bottom line for Amazon) by cutting out the middleman (publishing companies).</li>
        <li>They used leverage from the above to force publishing companies into better deals (for Amazon) for non self-published titles, lowering costs.</li>
        <li>They also lowered costs by opening up more space in the Fulfillment Centers, leaving more room for third party items and slowing the overall rate of building new, expensive buildings.</li>
        <li>They passed the savings on to customers creating more loyal shoppers, increasing customer base and cart size.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="section_name">Amazon, Instacart and the grocery vertical</h2>

      <p>I’m sure it’s abundantly clear to Instacart that Amazon intends to run this playbook on groceries, as they have made two relatively recent aggressive and related moves (the Whole Foods acquisition and the launch and upcoming <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/02/22/amazon-go-expansion/"> expansion of Amazon Go.</a> Combine this with prior art (Amazon Fresh in groceries and Amazon Prime Now in on-demand courier delivery) and it is evident Amazon intends to put every large grocery store in America out of business. Apoorva Mehta, Instacart’s founder, is also an ex-Amazonian so I am certain that Instacart is well aware that they are now at roughly DEFCON 2.</p>

     <p> Amazon is bringing the Everything Store to your neighborhood, and they are starting with what has made them essential in your daily lives up to now: high-frequency low-margin transactions.</p>

     <p><em>(As we will discuss : Amazon probably will not stop there. Don’t be surprised if they make a separate complimentary blockbuster acquisition [or make room in Whole Foods stores] to showcase and deliver the opposite — high-margin, low-frequency purchases. Think something like Best Buy.)</em></p>

    <p>Despite doom and gloom predictions, the Amazon/Whole Foods acquisition is actually initially Very Good News™ for Instacart. Every other grocer is flocking to Instacart to fill in the last mile delivery gap (well, last few miles, anyway), which has always been Amazon’s key strategic advantage aside from selection. The top eight grocers in the US all now have deals with Instacart. Amazon is the best in the logistics game and has used faster and cheaper delivery to destroy (and in the case of books, actually replace!) physical retailers and grocers are surely losing a lot of sleep over the prospect of Amazon entering their market so dramatically. Instacart is a welcome life raft and grocers are flocking to it.</p>

     <p> So everything seems to be going right for Instacart, with Amazon inadvertly pushing new customers their way. But…</p>

      <h2 class="section_name">Delivery alone will not save grocers</h2>

     <p>Third party delivery will not be enough to save Kroger, Albertson’s or Publix.</p>

      <p>It may extend their lifetimes, but Amazon has roughly one third of America as Prime members. Many of those consumers will happily accept the “free” delivery option from Whole Foods that will inevitably be part of their Prime membership — even if they haven’t ever set foot in a Whole Foods.</p>

      <p>But even that isn’t close to the biggest problem — most grocers aren’t even aware of what is coming for them. It boils down to the classic Bezos quote:</p>

      <blockquote>"Your margin is my opportunity"</blockquote>

      <p>Although Americans spend more than half a trillion dollars a year on groceries the margin for grocery is low at 2–3%. Amazon will expand that margin significantly though automation and vertical integration — and they will use it to destroy the competition.</p>

      <p>In the short term, the low-hanging fruit of Amazon’s logistics expertise from fulfillment centers will expand into every Whole Foods, reducing the overall number of employees and driving down fixed costs. But that’s just the beginning.</p>

      <p>Over the next five years Amazon Go will scale to most major cities in America. Much as AmazonFresh was not really about groceries but about Amazon learning to manage a fleet of delivery vehicles, Amazon Go is not about convenience stores but about removing friction from physical retail the same way Amazon did with e-commerce. Cashierless checkout will eventually make its way into all Whole Foods locations, eliminating almost all cashiers and baggers.</p>

      <p>The long game for Amazon in logistics has and always will be automation. On a longer time horizon even stockers may be nearly completely replaced by a smaller workforce and a fleet of Kiva robots. Imagine a grocery store of “shelves on wheels” that trade themselves out when inventory is low, or a dancing fleet of Kiva bots bringing cereal, bread or rice directly to you, the consumer.</p>

      <p>Or imagine that online grocery ordering is so successful that the large scale grocery store disappears entirely, with picking and packing largely done separately in a warehouse or section of the store free of pesky customers with their slow carts and tendency to misplace inventory. A Whole Foods may then transform to have a limited in-store browsable grocery section of essentials (which, remember, Amazon Go is currently perfecting) alongside other higher-margin Amazon products (something like Amazon’s take on the superstore).</p>

      <p>No matter the manifestation Amazon will “drive the price of diapers to zero” on everyday staples like milk, bread, cheese and meat as soon as they can, and in standard Amazon fashion they will pass their savings on to the customer to elbow out the competition, which will go broke trying to keep up.</p>

      <p>At this point it is checkmate for traditional grocers.</p>

      <p>Third party services like Instacart may actually then become a liability for grocers: grocers know they need delivery (they are completely dead otherwise) but they won’t want to be dependent on a single delivery provider anymore, as that provider may a) disappear or b) decide to leverage their monopoly and demand more of the grocery chains. This will leave Instacart vulnerable to adjacent competitors in the last-mile delivery space (Postmates, DoorDash, Uber, etc.) if they smell blood in the water, as the moat around grocery-specific delivery isn’t a particularly wide one as of this moment in time.</p>

      <h2 class="section_name">WWAMZNND?</h2>

      <p>Hope, however, is not lost. On the contrary, Instacart has a unique opportunity to actually beat Amazon at their own game. What Instacart has to ask is: what would Amazon not do?:</p>

      <li>
        Amazon is NOT going to offer any tooling to improve logistics for rival chains
        Amazon is NOT going to license “cashierless” technology to rival chains
        Amazon is going to own its own delivery method vertical and will NOT offer it as a service to rival delivery competitors
        In each case Instacart has the opportunity to step in and build the tools to help grocers remain competitive while at the same time making Instacart far more valuable to grocers than an additional convenience channel for their users —Instacart’s main mission should not be to deliver groceries. It should be to service existing grocers in every way possible to help them beat Amazon — and then apply that playbook to other retailers that Amazon is coming for next.
      </li>

      <h2 class="section_name">Inventory and Point of Sale</h2>

      <p>Here’s the actual screenshots from my most recent Instacart orders:</p>


      <p>To save some mental math, roughly 30% of the time Instacart either replaced my desired item or just canceled it from my order. In fact, I cannot find a single instance in my order history over the past few months without adjustments, either for alternates or refunds! This is especially frustrating because in part I use Instacart to supplement my normal grocery store (Whole Foods, incidentally) with items they don’t stock (name brand cleaning supplies, nationally-available dog food, toilet paper that does not cost $24, etc.).</p>

      <p>This suggests that Instacart does not not have accurate store inventory data. It is largely inconsequential if this is because the grocer itself does not have good or timely data or because Instacart is having trouble getting data in real time from a third party inventory system; the opportunity is the same: Instacart can give supermarkets (and itself) superpowers by becoming the Square* of the grocery space and providing the picks and shovels for inventory and point of sale.</p>

      <p class=footnote>*<em>(Note: Square is also one of the few other companies that can “out-Amazon” Amazon, but that is the topic of another post.)</em></p>

      <p>I’m willing to bet that the average grocery inventory and point of sale system is outdated. Most of them probably do not have real-time capabilities at all, nevertheless real-time externally-facing APIs that can tell Instacart Shoppers (and end users) if something is in stock or not. One of Instacart’s main medium-term goals should be to reduce replacements and refunds by at least 90%, and owning the inventory and POS systems can make than number 100% by default in participating stores.</p>

      <p>For grocers, the stakes are high: if “Whole Foods Prime” is accurate 100% of the time and Instacart is NOT 100% accurate every single time consumers will choose certainty over uncertainty. It’s what humans do.</p>

      <p>Real-time inventory parity with Whole Foods Prime will be table stakes for any other grocery delivery experience to compete, say, more than three years from today, in any major metropolis in America.</p>

      <p>Amazon will not offer this as a service to anyone. But Instacart can.</p>

      <p>By building the POS and inventory management system for grocers Instacart can finally have accurate inventory and be more indispensable to grocers (DoorDash isn’t likely to build a rival system).</p>

      Warehousing and Logistics
      
      <p>If Amazon does indeed deploy future Whole Foods Prime locations as (at least partly) as non-retail, delivery-only, robot-optimized distribution centers, supermarkets and Instacart will be at yet another disadvantage when it comes to picking/packing inventory. Rickety carts, other customers, lines at the butcher counter, lines at checkout are all liabilities that slow Instacart down. Again, Amazon will be at an advantage not just on fixed costs over traditional grocers (no decor/escalators/signage/high traffic rent needed) but on variable costs (e.g. part time labor) and most importantly, speed.</p>

      <p>In this scenario, Whole Foods Prime would not only be more accurate but also faster. And customers will always chose the faster option over the slower one. It’s what humans do.</p>

      <p>Instacart will have to cut Amazon off at at the pass here. Does this mean that Instacart needs to build robot-powered localized fulfillment centers? No — that’s just the approach Amazon has built to handle this problem. I will leave it up to the reader to imagine how Instacart can beat Amazon at upstream fulfillment which probably means something earlier than picking the item out of the store after it has already been shelved but later than it being picked from the farm. Somewhere in that gap Instacart has to aim for the sweet spot of accurate inventory existing in a localized enough manner to get an order out the door as fast or faster than Whole Foods Prime once someone hits the Checkout button.</p>

      <p>Amazon actually *may* offer this as a service to the Krogers of the world (in an effort to kill Instacart), although I think they are more interested in owning the vertical outright and have learned lessons about “non-conforming” products throwing wrenches in Prime (e.g., extra charges for heavy items, or the Add-on program for items to small to be shipped cost efficiently; perishables take that to a whole other level.)</p>

      <p>So I feel confident in saying: Amazon will probably not offer this as a service to anyone. But Instacart can.</p>

      <h2 class="section_name">Frictionless checkout</h2>

      <p>Although I believe Amazon is hoping to offload much of Whole Foods ordering to warehouses without pesky obstacles for robots to avoid (shoppers), they are going to offer a killer feature in the places they will have a physical presence — the ability to just walk in and out without waiting in a line, ever. This is more than just a whiz-bang feature. I would argue this is Amazon’s biggest single strategic initiative in retail — to take to the physical world what they have done for e-commerce.</p>

      <p>They’re focusing on Amazon Go right now because it’s smaller and easier to control less SKUs/customers, but they can and will scale it to Whole Foods scale to put The Fear™ in the heart of Kroger and other major grocers.</p>

      <p>In a doomsday scenario for retailers they will do it in every physical location they own now or in the future. And Amazon is aiming for the heart here. I strongly believe Amazon plans to destroy not just grocery but Wal-Mart, Target, Best-Buy and others by making it as simple as walking in and and walking out of your local store. Provided you’re a Prime member, of course.</p>

      <p>Instacart, as a delivery company (and not a direct retailer), might not be interested in this right now, but I would argue this should keep them up at night. Why?</p>

      <p>First, as I mentioned before, accurate inventory is important to their existing customer base, and the computer vision/machine learning triangulation behind cashierless checkout is only going to help make that more real-time and accurate.</p>

      <p>Second, you guessed it: Amazon is never going to offer a similar service to another retailer. But Instacart can.</p>

      <p>That second point is huge, because if Instacart can catch up and offer grocers self-checkout they can do what Amazon would never do. They can offer cashierless checkout and up-to-the-second inventory accuracy to Best Buy. To Target. To Wal-Mart. To GAP. To Macy’s.To Home Depot. To every physical retailer on earth, potentially. Those companies MUST adopt a solution if Amazon deploys it at scale, otherwise Amazon will just repeat the playbook — enter a vertical market using fewer employees, incentivizing consumers with less friction and lower prices, reducing fixed costs and generating higher margins from traditionally margin-poor businesses— and they’ll slowly push each of those companies out of town, even if it takes 20 years.</p>

      <p>Assuming a company like Instacart did directly challenge Amazon with a true competitor in the frictionless checkout space and Amazon was forced to offer cashierless checkout as-a-service as an effort at put the genie back in the bottle and maintain market share, everyone will have been so afraid of being eaten by Amazon for as long as they can remember that Amazon would be unlikely to find many takers. (This is, incidentally, part of why Amazon Payments never took off).</p>

      <p>Whoever gets there first is in the driver’s seat, because all of brick-and-mortar hates Amazon, and that company will be very, very important to the future of commerce. Instacart could be that company. Brick-and-mortar retailers have been losing the fight against Amazon for 15 years, but with right moves Instacart can help them win again.</p>

      <h2 class="section_name">The future of the last mile</h2>

      <p>We’re far out at sea now, but in the distant future Amazon is going to continue to remove humans from the delivery chain in the interest of lowering costs. It is almost certain they have their own version of Nuro (or an acquisition of a company cut from that cloth) in the works (drones are going to be bad at most deliveries and are mostly a chimera to keep people from realizing Amazon’s major logistics innovations are likely to remain in traditional sea, air and land). Maybe Amazon will deliver packages for consumers a-la-FedEx, but when it comes to Whole Foods Prime: again, Amazon will not be sharing this with anyone — unless those grocers have no other choice.</p>

      <p>I’m not suggesting here that Instacart needs a self-driving delivery car division (for example, strategic partnerships may be a cheaper or more viable path to a solution on a shorter horizon). But Instacart’s margin is in no small part dependent on human drivers in addition to shoppers, and Amazon is coming to leverage Instacart’s margin as Amazon’s opportunity there as well.</p>

      <p>Instacart needs to think about that future, however distant it may seem, now. I assure you Amazon is thinking about it.</p>

      <p>And they aren’t going to offer it to anyone else. </p>
